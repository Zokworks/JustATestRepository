GDD for tank game

A normal tank game with rolling mechanics for dodging bullets.

Tank shots need to play an animation before firing.

There should be a .3 second delay when attempting to fire vs actually shooting a projectile to give the other player time to dodge

Players can only dodge in the direction that they are moving in.

Tanks will be hovertanks that can move along terrain without treads. (Model for this should be made in either tiltbrush, Unreal itself, or ZBrush)
